# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce dataset using SQL and pandas in Python. The primary goal is to derive actionable insights that can help inform business decisions and strategies. The analyses cover various aspects of the dataset, including revenue growth, customer behavior, product performance, and retention rates.

## Data Analysis

### Monthly Revenue Growth Analysis
- Calculated monthly revenue for the past year.
- Determined month-over-month growth rates to identify trends and highlight significant changes in revenue.

### Top Customers Identification
- Identified the top 3 customers based on their total spending.
- Provided insights into customer purchasing behavior and loyalty.

### Recent Revenue Calculation
- Calculated the total revenue generated in the last 3 months.
- Assessed recent financial performance to inform business decisions.

### Product Variant Analysis
- Counted distinct product variants sold within each category.
- Highlighted categories with the highest product diversity and sales.

### High Quantity Orders
- Identified customers with orders exceeding a quantity of 15 items.
- Provided insights into bulk purchasing behavior and potential B2B customers.

### Monthly Average Order Amount
- Calculated the average order amount for each month in the current year.
- Highlighted months with the highest average order values.

### Advanced Analyses
1. **Monthly Revenue Growth**:
   - Analyzed revenue changes by comparing the current month's revenue with the previous month's revenue.

2. **Product Purchase Analysis**:
   - Investigated customer purchase behavior for a specific product.

3. **Customer Retention Rate Calculation**:
   - Calculated the retention rate of customers over the last 12 months.

4. **Unsold Products in the Last 6 Months**:
   - Identified products that have not been sold in the last 6 months.


## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **SQL**: Crafted complex queries to extract and manipulate data efficiently.
- **Pandas**: Utilized pandas for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Applied logical and analytical skills to derive actionable insights from raw data.

## Results

The detailed results of the analyses are documented in the Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/analysis.ipynb`). This notebook provides a step-by-step explanation of each analysis, along with the corresponding SQL queries and pandas operations.
